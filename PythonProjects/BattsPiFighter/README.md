# BE SURE TO CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH

### Rev 1
 - Read in the button clicks is the main goal here.  Have a light turn on when you click a button.  Next when the button clicks, have something populate in your program.
 - Once you get 1 button, get 2 buttons

### Rev 2
 - Build a cookie clicker type game where there is some interaction on the screen.  
 - Build out a health bar or something that updates as you click the button
 - You could make it like a battle bar type thing where as player 1 presses the button, the bar moves to the right and vise versa for player 2

### Rev 3
 - iteractive game like PiFighter by Richard Kirby
 - May start looking at different sensors with it.
 - Look at reading in a controller.
