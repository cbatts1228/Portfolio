# About Me

  My name is Caden Batts, I'm a senior in high school. I enjoy learning about the software side of Computers, I plan on going to Purdue to study Computer Science and then eventually finding a career in Software Development or maybe even Game Development. I chose to major in Computer Science because I like the idea of having a broader range of fields I can try out instead of being stuck with a more specific field. I'm a very outgoing person so I enjoy meeting new people and making new friends. I'm hoping that I'll get to work on projects with other people in college and when I start working. A fun fact about me is that I play guitar in a bluegrass band with my family. I can also play saxophone and I want to learn how to play the piano in the future.
